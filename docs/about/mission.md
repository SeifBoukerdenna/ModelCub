# Mission

<div class="mission-hero">
  <p class="mission-statement">
    Make computer vision development accessible to everyone. No cloud bills, no vendor lock-in, no data leaving your machine. Just simple, powerful tools that respect your privacy and your budget.
  </p>
</div>

## The Problem We're Solving

Computer vision teams waste **70-80% of their time** on dataset management:
- Debugging corrupt images and invalid labels
- Paying thousands per month for cloud platforms
- Losing track of dataset versions
- Dealing with privacy and compliance barriers

**We believe this is broken.**

## Our Solution

ModelCub provides the infrastructure CV teams actually need:

**Local-First**
Your data never leaves your machine. Train on medical imaging, pharmaceutical data, or any sensitive dataset without compliance headaches.

**Zero Cost**
No subscriptions, no per-seat pricing, no surprise bills. Save tens of thousands per year compared to cloud platforms.

**Developer-Focused**
Built by developers who felt the pain. Clean APIs, clear documentation, and automation that actually works.

**Reproducible**
Version datasets like code. Full audit trail for research, compliance, and debugging.

## What Success Looks Like

By 2026, when a CV team needs to:
- Manage datasets → They use ModelCub
- Train models locally → They use ModelCub
- Ensure reproducibility → They use ModelCub

We're building the **de facto open-source toolkit** for local-first computer vision.

## Our Commitment

- **Privacy is non-negotiable**: No telemetry, no tracking, no exceptions
- **Always open source**: MIT license, forever
- **Community-driven**: We listen, iterate, and ship based on real feedback
- **Quality over features**: Every release is stable and well-documented

## Join Us

ModelCub is more than software—it's a movement toward:
- Data sovereignty
- Developer empowerment
- Open, reproducible ML

Whether you're a researcher, startup, or enterprise team, you belong here.
